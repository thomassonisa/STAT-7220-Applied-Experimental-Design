    "\n",
    "- When we think about statistics and data science, very often our minds go straight to the analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, being able to effectively answer questions with data requires a systematic, well-thought-out approach.\n",
    "    - The analysis is only part of it!\n",
    "\n",
    "- For us, the scientific method lays out a nice framework that we can use to guide our thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scientific Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember from high school science class that the scientific method generally involves:\n",
    "    1. Making a hypothesis about some phenomenon\n",
    "        - This includes defining our independent (features) and dependent (targets) variables\n",
    "    2. Collecting data to test the hypothesis\n",
    "    3. Analyzing the data\n",
    "    4. Drawing conclusions from the data\n",
    "    5. Refining the hypothesis and repeating the process\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even if we aren't working in laboratory sciences, this systematic approach helps us make sure we're using the right data to answer the right question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I like to call working through steps 1 - 5 of the scientific method a **study**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally speaking, we can classify studies into two categories:\n",
    "    1. **Observational Studies**\n",
    "    2. **Experimental Studies**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In an **observational study**, we are simply observing our independent and dependent variables. We don't have control over how observational units get assigned to specific values of either the independent or dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observational Study Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, suppose I wanted to know if the mean annual income differs between undergraduate data science majors and psychology majors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case, mean annual income serves as my quantitative dependent (or outcome) variable and major (data science or psychology) serves as my categorical independent (or predictor/explanatory) variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I as the researcher in this case don't have control over whether students are data science or psychology majors -- I'm simply observing a phenomenon.\n",
    "    - So this study would be classified as an *observational* study.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's contrast this with an experimental study.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental Study Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's say you work for a marketing department in a retail company. We have an email list of 10,000 customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to test the impact of two different email subject lines (e.g., a generic subject line and a personalized subject line) on annual spending with our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case, we could randomly assign our customers to either the generic subject line group or the personalized subject line group and follow their spending over the course of a year before making a comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Email group serves as our categorical independent variable and annual spending serves as our quantitative outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But notice in this case, we the researcher assigned the participants to their respective groups.\n",
    "    - This is the key difference between observational and experimental research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should I Care About Experimentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "- While we may often associate experiments with laboratory science, experimental design is actually very helpful in a variety of fields including:\n",
    "    1.  Engineering\n",
    "    2.  Manufacturing/Quality Control\n",
    "    3.  Marketing\n",
    "    4.  Social Science\n",
    "    5.  Educational Research\n",
    "    6.  Much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "- The roots of DOE (design of experiments) go back to Fisher himself as he aimed to study crop yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over the course of the semester, you will see how DOE is important to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informed Decision-Making**: It provides a structured approach to testing hypotheses, allowing people/organizations to make data-driven decisions based on reliable evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Optimization**: By identifying what works and what doesn't, people/organizations can allocate their resources more efficiently, avoiding wasted time and money on ineffective strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process Improvement**: Well-designed experiments can uncover insights that lead to innovative solutions and improvements, which may serve as a competitive advantage in a business setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before we go much further, it may be helpful if we have some agreed upon definitions (so we're speaking the same language!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note, if there is ever a time when a term is used in these slides or elsewhere that doesn't seem well-defined, **PLEASE ASK FOR GUIDANCE!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment (or Run)**: an action where the experimenter changes at least one of the variables being studied and then observes the effect of the action.\n",
    "    - Randomizing our customers into the generic and personalized email groups and then observing their purchasing behavior was an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experimental Unit**: the item under study upon which something is changed. This could be raw materials, human subjects, or just a point in time.\n",
    "    - Our individual customers in the marketing example were our experimental units.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent Variable (Factor or Treatment Factor or Feature)**: We generally think of this as the $X$ variable that is being controlled at some level during any given experiment.\n",
    "    - Email group from the prior example\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lurking Variable (Background Variable)**: a variable that the experimenter is unaware of or cannot control which could have an effect on the outcome of the experiment.\n",
    "    - In the email example, annual income probably plays a role in annual spending. This isn't something the marketing department can control.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable (or Response or Outcome or Target)**: Usually denoted $Y$, this is the characteristic of the experimental unit that is measured after each experiment/run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect**: The change in the response that is caused by a change in a factor/independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These definitions will get us started, but there will be more new terms added as we progress through the semester!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key to successful experiments (and studies in general really) is a very clear articulation about what you're studying, why you're studying it, how you're studying it, and how you'll draw conclusions from the experiment(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- More specifically: \n",
    "    - **(1)** Define the objective \n",
    "    - **(2)** Decide what the outcome is (and how it will be measured) \n",
    "    - **(3)** Determine the independent variables and possible lurking variables\n",
    "    - **(4)** Choose the design (more on this as the semester progresses) \n",
    "    - **(5)** Be clear on data collection processes/procedures \n",
    "    - **(6)** Be clear on which analyses will be performed and how they are appropriate for the objective and design\n",
    "    - **(7)** Draw conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the semester progresses, we will systematically go through each of these steps in every lecture, example, and assignment. "
